# QuantumMate Chess Engine

## Overview

QuantumMate is a powerful chess engine implemented in Python. It leverages the Minimax algorithm enhanced with Alpha-Beta pruning and move ordering to efficiently evaluate chess positions and make optimal moves.

## Features

- **Minimax Algorithm**: Fundamental AI algorithm for decision-making in game theory.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimization technique to reduce the number of nodes evaluated by the Minimax algorithm.
- **Move Ordering**: Heuristic to improve the efficiency of Alpha-Beta pruning by sorting moves to be considered in a specific order.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tushar-badlani/QuantumMate.git
    cd QuantumMate
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
